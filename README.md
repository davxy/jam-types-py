# JAM Types

Python implementation of types and codecs for the [JAM Protocol](https://graypaper.com).

This package provides SCALE codec implementations for all JAM protocol data
structures, including blocks, work packages, tickets, state transitions, and
cryptographic primitives.

## JAM Codec

The JAM codec is derived from SCALE (Simple Concatenated Aggregate Little-Endian)
with one key difference: **compact integer encoding**. While SCALE uses a
prefix-based compact encoding, JAM codec implements a different approach for
compact integer representation as specified in the JAM protocol.

All other encoding rules (structs, enums, vectors, fixed arrays, etc.) remain
compatible with SCALE.

## Features

- Complete type definitions for JAM protocol structures
- JAM codec encoding/decoding support (SCALE-derived with custom compact integers)
- Multiple specification profiles (full/tiny)
- CLI tools for decoding and analyzing JAM data
- Fuzzer support for protocol testing
- Type introspection utilities

## Installation

### Direct Installation

Install from source:

```bash
pip install .
```

Or install in development mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Using install.sh Script

Alternatively, use the provided installation script that automatically sets up
a dedicated virtual environment:

```bash
./install.sh
```

The script will:
- Create a virtual environment in `$HOME/.local/pip/jam-types` (or `$PIP_LOCAL_VENV/jam-types` if set)
- Install the package and its dependencies in isolation
- Provide activation instructions for the environment

This approach differs from direct pip installation by automatically managing a
separate virtual environment, preventing conflicts with system packages or other
Python projects.

## Usage

### As a Library

```python
from jam_types import Block, WorkReport, ScaleBytes
from jam_types.spec import set_spec

# Use tiny spec (6 validators, 12 epoch length)
set_spec('tiny')

# Decode a block from binary data
blob = open('block.bin', 'rb').read()
scale_bytes = ScaleBytes(blob)
block = Block(data=scale_bytes)
decoded = block.decode()

# Access block fields
print(decoded['header'])
print(decoded['extrinsic'])
```

### CLI Tools

#### jam-decode

Decode binary JAM data to JSON:

```bash
# Decode from file (type inferred from filename)
jam-decode -f report.bin

# Decode with explicit type
jam-decode -f data.bin -t Block

# Decode hex string directly
jam-decode -d "0x1234567890abcdef" -t Header

# Use specific spec
jam-decode -f block.bin -t Block --spec tiny
```

Supported types include:
- Protocol types: `Block`, `Header`, `WorkReport`, `WorkPackage`, etc.
- Fuzzer types: `Genesis`, `TraceStep`, `Report`, `Message`, `WireMessage`
- Any type from `jam_types` modules (supports both CamelCase and snake_case)

#### jam-diff

Compare two decoded structures:

```bash
# Compare two files
jam-diff -f block1.bin -f block2.bin -t Block

# Compare hex data
jam-diff -d "0x1234" -d "0x5678" -t Header

# Mix files and hex data
jam-diff -f genesis.bin -d "0xabcd" -t genesis

# Verbose mode (show full content with inline markers)
jam-diff -f data1.bin -f data2.bin -t WorkReport -v
```

#### jam-types-info

Display type and spec information:

```bash
# Show current spec
jam-types-info

# List all available types
jam-types-info --types

# Show structure of specific type
jam-types-info --type Block

# Show spec details
jam-types-info --spec full
```

## Specifications

JAM Types supports multiple protocol specifications:

### Full Spec
- 1023 validators
- 600 epoch length
- 16 max tickets per block

### Tiny Spec
- 6 validators
- 12 epoch length
- 3 max tickets per block

Set the spec programmatically or via environment variable:

```python
from jam_types.spec import set_spec
set_spec('tiny')
```

```bash
export JAM_SPEC=full
```

## Development
